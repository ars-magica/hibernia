These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.  Many casters of False Window add an additional magnitude, so that figures within the image appear to move, and the pattern of light changes to suit the time of day, but this simpler version creates only a static image.

That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located. As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location.

Note that this spell uses the Perdo Vim guideline, which dispels magic effects of a specific type (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 160). Parma Magica is an example of a magical effect of a specific type, which all Hermetic magi are familiar with.
