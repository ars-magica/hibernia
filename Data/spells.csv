Gift of the Frog's Legs,ReCo15,Re,,Co,,15,Touch,Mom,Ind,,"Allows the target to leap up to 15 feet vertically or 25 feet horizontally (2 feet less for every Encumbrance point). The person must make a Dexterity – Encumbrance stress roll of 0+ to land without injury. A miss indicates that he takes a Light Wound, and a botch indicates a Medium Wound. The target can only leap once for each casting of the spell, and that leap must be made within ten seconds. As with a frog’s leap, a running start does not improve the leap.","Base 10, +1 Touch",,[ArM5:134]

This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of molten iron. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire doing less than +15 damage per round doesn’t penetrate the ward.

False Window,CrIm5,Cr,,Im,,5,Touch,Sun,Ind,,"This spell allows the magus to trace the frame of a door or window and create a miniature that seems to show something that lies beyond the frame. A Perception + Finesse roll is required to craft a convincing illusion. The Ease Factor is 9 if the image seems to show a room, 12 if it seems to show a structure, or 15 if it seems to run to the horizon. These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.  Many casters of False Window add an additional magnitude, so that figures within the image appear to move, and the pattern of light changes to suit the time of day, but this simpler version creates only a static image. This spell also models similar spells for the other senses: a mirror that plays a tune, provided its face is not turned toward a wall, is an example. Directly created species like these are resisted by the Parma Magica.","Base 2, +2 Sun or Ring, +1 Individual",,[HoH:S:68]

Book of Images,CrIm15,Cr,,Im,,15,Touch,Ring,Ind,,"This spell creates moving sounds and images that are stored in a circle (such as a drawn circle on paper) as long as it is intact.

The Shadow of Human Life,CrIm40,Cr,,Im,Me,40,Touch,Sun,Ind,,"The human image created (as in Phantasm of the Human Form) has limited freedom and simulated intellect.

Brushstrokes Revealed,InIm10,In,,Im,,10,Touch,Ring,Circle,,"This spell makes the species cast by an object within the circle more vivid, so that the magus can see tiny details that are otherwise invisible. This spell has traditionally been used to investigate the physical construction of artworks, but nature-oriented Jerbiton magi have recently begun using it to investigate the handiwork of God, by examining the tiny structures of creation.","Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Ring",,[HoH:S:65]

Things do not all appear to be a foot away; you can simply make out details as well as if they were. You can still judge distance accurately; in fact, more accurately than normal, to within an inch or so at a distance of several miles, since you can see as clearly as if you were judging distance a foot away.","Base 3, +2 Sun, +4 Vision",,Custom variant [ArM5:145]
Aura of Ennobled Presence,MuIm10,Mu,,Im,,10,Touch,Sun,Ind,,"The target appears more forceful, authoritative, and believable.

Image from the Wizard Torn,ReIm30,Re,In,Im,,30,Per,Conc,Ind,,"Your image separates from your body and moves as you do. It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. You must make an Int + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an Arcane Connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located. As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location.  The image is your image, so while you may move it in space you may not have it sit down if you are standing. Further, it appears as if illuminated by whatever light is falling on you, no matter what the level of illumination is at the image.","Base 15, +1 Concentration, +1 additional sense, +1 Intellego requisite",,[ArM:147]

Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto or Rego spell, since it is usually easier to change a target’s emotions after you’ve sensed them than it is to create emotions.","Base 10, +1 Eye",,[ArM5:149]
Posing the Silent Question,InMe20,In,,Me,,20,Eye,Mom,Ind,,"You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of “What would you do if . . . ?” often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she makes a Magic Resistance roll.","Base 15, +1 Eye",,[ArM5:139]
Trust of the Childlike Faith,PeMe10,Pe,,Me,,10,Touch,Diam,Ind,,"The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell.
