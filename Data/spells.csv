It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. You must make an Int + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an Arcane Connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located. As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location.  The image is your image, so while you may move it in space you may not have it sit down if you are standing. Further, it appears as if illuminated by whatever light is falling on you, no matter what the level of illumination is at the image.","Base 15, +1 Concentration, +1 additional sense, +1 Intellego requisite",,[ArM:147]

This has advantages (the caster doesnâ€™t need to maintain concentration) and disadvantages (the tunnel cannot be swiftly closed by ceasing to concentrate).
