The covenant has always treated him well, in honour of his father. However, he cannot free himself from his father's fate and has never been able to trust the magi. His mother remarried and he has a couple of half-siblings in the village He has always found himself a bit of an outsider, but found refuge at the kennel when Una was not there. Seeing his aptitude with dogs, Una's mundane assistants trained him."

The horse was chased by three dark fey, a rabbit, a ram, and a wolf.  They meet a magic owl in a tree with an ancient hole, saying that the hole was made by the horn of a unicorn who since lost the horn to someone who made it into a weapon.  On the second visit, the tree is gone.  Tiou and Sean recover the horn from a mound which also contains an Hermetic sanctum.  Eogan stays out of the mound, for fear of the magi's dangers.  The aura there is faerie."
